# Creating the github actions workflow

Create a file named `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` with the content below. To create file you can type `code .github/workflows/main.yml` in the terminal and then save it with Ctrl+S (Win) or CMD+S (MacOS).
If you're using a public repository, github offers a generous amount of free minutes for github actions, so don't be shy top test each job and see how it behaves in details before adding another to your pipeline, and pay attention to your formatting since we will be addind each step one by one.

```yaml
name: Go CI/CD with GitHub Actions

on:
  push:
    branches: ['YOUR MAIN/MASTER or BRANCH(es) NAME(s)']
```

This step will decide what triggers your pipeline. In this case we are using a push to main to trigger the pipeline, but you can also use pull requests, tags, or other events.

Next, we will handle linting and formating, add the following code to the file:
Also, if you used another version of go remember to change the version to the one you are using.

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: 1.23.0
      - name: golangci-lint
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6
        with:
          version: v1.60
```

Next we will handle building and testing the application.
We fetch the code, cache files and install dependencies then test the code, and at the last stage we build the binary.
Add the following code to the file:

```yaml
build-test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: lint
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: '1.23.0'

    - name: Cache Go modules
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: |
          ~/go/pkg/mod
          ~/go/cache
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('go.sum') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('go.sum') }}
          ${{ runner.os }}-go-

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: go mod download

    - name: Run vet
      run: go vet ./...

    - name: Run tests
      run: go test -v ./...

    - name: Create bin directory
      run: mkdir -p ./bin

    - name: Build
      run: go build -v -o ./bin/goapi ./main.go
```

For the next step we will build , tag and push the image to docker hub. but before we do, you will need to create a docker hub account and create a repository.
Then add your Docker usernmae and docker password to the secrets of your repository.
Once you have done that, add the following code to the file and dont forget to put your repository name in the placeholder text:

```yaml
docker-push:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build-test
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - run: echo "JOB ID =====> ${{ github.run_id }} from branch ${{ github.ref }}"

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Extract branch name
      shell: bash
      run: echo "BRANCH_NAME=$(echo ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF:-${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}} | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/-/g')" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Generate Docker metadata
      id: meta
      uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
      with:
        images: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/YOUR DOCKER REPOSITORY NAME
        tags: |
          type=raw,value=${{ env.BRANCH_NAME }}-{{date 'YYYYMMDDHHmm'}}
          type=raw,value=${{ env.BRANCH_NAME }}-latest

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: .
        push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
        tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
        labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```

And now the deploy stage , keep in mind that if you are using hosted services such are render or railway or any other service that build your app by a docker image that woul be you CD or deploy stage.

We will see examples for building on digital ocean or any other VPS , AWS and Azure

```yaml
deploy-to-vps:
  needs: build-test
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to server
      run: echo "Deploying to server..."
      # - name: Deploy to Digital Ocean droplet
      #   uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      #   with:
      #     host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
      #     username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
      #     key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      #     script: |
      #       cd /path/to/your/project
      #       git pull origin main
      #       go build
      #       sudo systemctl restart your-go-app.service
```

```yaml
deploy-to-aws:
  needs: build-test
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: '1.23.0'

    - name: Build Go application
      run: go build -o myapp ./main.go

    #- name: Set up SSH key
    #  uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
    #  with:
    #    ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

    #  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
    # with:
    #  host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
    #    username: ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}
    #   key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    #    script: |
    #      cd /path/to/your/project
    #     git pull origin main
    #     go build
    #      sudo systemctl restart your-go-app.service
```

and finally the azure example

```yaml
deploy-to-azure:
  needs: build-test
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: '1.23.0'

    - name: Build Go application
      run: go build -o myapp ./main.go

    - name: Package application
      run: zip myapp.zip myapp

  #  - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
  #    uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  #    with:
  #      app-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
  #      publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
  #      package: myapp.zip
```
