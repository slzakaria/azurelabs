# Seting up go

Many widely-used DevOps tools, like docker, kubernetes, and terraform, are written in golang, due to its ability to handle concurrent tasks efficiently and execute rapidly.
In this lab , we will be taking part in devops practice by creating a CI/CD process for a go application using github actions.

But before we can get to the cicd part , we must first install go and create our app,the app itself will not be our focus on this lab but will give information where needed.

Go ahead and open Terminal in the Code Editor so that we can install go. To open Terminal press CTRL+` On Windows or CMD+J on MacOS.
Or you can go to terminal on the menubar.

Usually , you can install go by downloading the binary from the official website (<https://go.dev/dl/>) , but since we are using a virtual machine , we will be using the following command to install go and then extract it.

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Next Set up the Go environment variables. Add these lines to your ~/.profile file:

```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.profile
echo "export GOPATH=\$HOME/go" >> ~/.profile
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.profile
```

And finally, reload the profile and check if the installation was successful:

```bash
source ~/.profile
go env && go version
```

You should get a bunch of results and at the end you should see something like this:
go version go1.23.0 linux/amd64

That means that the installation was successful.
